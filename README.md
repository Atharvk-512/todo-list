# Todo List App
Welcome to my very first React project! I'm thrilled to present this simple todo list app that I've built from scratch. As a beginner in the world of web development, this project has been an exciting journey of learning and growth.
<br>
This app may not have all the bells and whistles of more complex task management tools, but it's a labor of love and a fantastic starting point for anyone new to React. It allows you to add tasks and delete them effortlessly â€“ a fundamental feature of any todo list app.
<br>
Throughout this project, I've had the opportunity to dive into the world of React, mastering components, state management, and the basics of creating a functional user interface. It's been a fantastic way to apply what I've learned and gain hands-on experience in web development.
<br>
I want to thank you for checking out my app, and I hope it serves as inspiration for fellow beginners who are just starting their journey into the world of React and web development. This is just the beginning for me, and I can't wait to continue honing my skills and creating more exciting projects in the future.
